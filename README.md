# 🚨 MAFIA-Net  
### Multimodal Arabic Fake-news Identification via Hybrid Attention Networks 🧠🖼️📝

## 📌 Overview
This repository provides a curated dataset and an experimental notebook for **Arabic multimodal fake news detection**.  
The dataset includes **tweet IDs**, **binary labels (Fake/Real)**, and **source dataset names**, enabling researchers and students to explore **image–text misinformation** on Arabic social media platforms.

The accompanying notebook demonstrates how to load the dataset, conduct ablation experiments, and evaluate multimodal learning architectures in a reproducible manner.

---

## 📂 Dataset Format
The dataset is released as "MafiaNetDataset.csv" with the following structure:

- `id` – Twitter Tweet ID  
- `label` – Class label (`0` = Fake, `1` = Real)  
- `dataset` – Source dataset name  

✔️ Only Tweet IDs are shared to fully comply with Twitter/X data-sharing policies.

## 🗂️ Data Collection
- Arabic tweets were collected from **multiple misinformation-related sources**, including COVID-19 content, rumors, and fake news datasets.
- Data acquisition was performed using the **Twitter API** (e.g., Tweepy) or web scraping tools.
- Labels were inherited from **existing Arabic unimodal annotated datasets**, enabling scalable multimodal annotation with minimal manual effort.
- Text and media content can be programmatically retrieved using the provided tweet IDs.
